astronomer here! you are right but with one very important detail that should be emphasized- we do not know if the signal only lasted 72 seconds, or that even the radio signal itself was varying during that time frame. to explain, the radio telescope that saw the wow! signal detected sources by just seeing what went overhead during the earth's rotation. the size of its feed horn (ie what was looking at the sky) was such that if you had a bright radio source in the sky there constantly it would look like it was steadily increasing in signal, peak, and then steadily decrease as it went out of the field of view you were looking at. so this is what the wow! signal was like- the signal varied, but that does not mean the source that was causing it to vary necessarily was. in fact, it was probably quite bright and constant. it's just the telescope was automatically running and no one saw the signal until the next day, so we can't say anything more about the duration than it was on during those 72 seconds the telescope was pointed in that direction.
