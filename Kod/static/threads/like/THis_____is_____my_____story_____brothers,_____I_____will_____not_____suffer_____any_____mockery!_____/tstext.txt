Once upon a time the goddess of the moon, Rhiannon, ruled with her father over the land of fairies. Rhiannon lived in her father's crystal palace at the edge of a shimmering lake. She was so sweet that everyone fell in love with her, and when she was grown, her father promised her in marriage to a man Rhiannon did not love. She could not love him, for she was already in love with a mortal, Prince Pwyll. One spring afternoon, as Pwyll was in the forest with his friends, he happened to step upon a Tor, a magical spot covering the entrance to the fairy world below. In that moment Rhiannon appeared before him, and he fell instantly in love at the sight of this beautiful woman in glittering gold. She was riding her handsome white horse, and she galloped past without even turning to look at Pwyll. From that moment he could think of nothing but her. "I must marry that girl," Pwyll said. "You're mad," his friends told him. "You cannot love one of the fairies; she has only bewitched you." But Pwyll did not listen. Instead, he sent his servant to catch Rhiannon. The servant set off, but soon returned to report the goddess had escaped.
